# DJ Queue Bot

A sophisticated Turntable.fm bot for managing DJ queues in music rooms with automatic queue management, fair play enforcement, and real-time updates.

## üéµ Overview

The DJ Queue Bot provides an automated queue management system for Turntable.fm rooms, designed to handle crowded rooms where many users want to DJ. It ensures everyone gets a fair chance to play music through intelligent queue management, dynamic rule enforcement, and comprehensive admin controls.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéØ Smart Queue Management
- **Automatic DJ Detection**: Automatically adds users to the queue when they join the decks
- **Dynamic Rule Enforcement**: Switches between relaxed and strict modes based on queue size
- **Fair Play System**: Prevents users from monopolizing the decks when others are waiting
- **Persistent Queue**: Users remain in queue even when stepping down from decks

### ‚ö° Real-Time Features
- **Live Queue Updates**: Publishes queue status to Redis every 10 seconds
- **Song Tracking**: Broadcasts current song information for external integrations
- **Instant Notifications**: Real-time feedback for all queue operations
- **Auto-Sync**: Synchronizes with current DJ booth state

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Controls
- **Admin Override System**: Comprehensive admin controls for queue management
- **Queue Locking**: Prevents unauthorized queue modifications
- **Wait Time Management**: Configurable cooldown periods between DJ turns
- **Graceful User Handling**: Manages user disconnections and refreshes intelligently

## üìã Queue Rules & Behavior

### Dynamic Queue Modes

**Relaxed Mode** (< 6 users in queue):
- DJs can play multiple songs per turn
- No automatic removal from decks
- Flexible queue management

**Strict Mode** (6+ users in queue):
- Each DJ limited to **one song per turn**
- **1-minute cooldown** before rejoining decks
- Automatic enforcement to ensure fairness
- Users remain in queue during cooldown

### User Lifecycle Management

1. **Joining**: Users automatically added to queue when they get on decks
2. **Playing**: Song count tracked per DJ turn
3. **Cooldown**: 1-minute wait period in strict mode
4. **Rejoining**: Can rejoin queue after cooldown expires
5. **Leaving**: 30-second grace period for page refreshes

## üîå Redis Integration & Discord Bot

The bot provides real-time data through Redis channels for external integrations and includes a companion Discord bot for enhanced functionality.

### Redis Channels

#### Channel 1: Queue Status (`channel-1`)
Published every 10 seconds with current queue state:

```json
{
  "DJs": "username1, username2, username3",
  "locked": false
}
```

**Special States:**
- `"DJs": "disabled"` - Queue system is disabled
- `"DJs": "Empty"` - No users in queue

#### Channel 2: Song Information (`channel-2`)
Published on every new song:

```json
{
  "songName": "Song Title",
  "artist": "Artist Name", 
  "djName": "DJ Username",
  "startTime": 1683842567890,
  "roomName": "Room Name"
}
```

### Discord Bot Integration

The companion Discord bot subscribes to both Redis channels and provides additional features for community engagement and event scheduling.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

### Concurrency Control
- **Mutex-based locking** prevents race conditions
- **Sequential command processing** maintains data integrity
- **Atomic queue operations** ensure consistency
- **Error-safe releases** prevent deadlocks

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Real-time event handling** for user actions
- **Automatic state synchronization** with room events
- **Graceful error recovery** and logging
- **Clean shutdown procedures**

### Configuration Constants

```javascript
const QUEUE_SIZE_THRESHOLD = 6;    // When strict mode activates
const QUEUE_FULL_SIZE = 5;         // "Full queue" announcement
const DJ_WAIT_TIME = 60000;        // 1-minute cooldown (ms)
const REFRESH_GRACE_PERIOD = 30000; // 30-second rejoin window
const PUBLISH_INTERVAL = 10000;    // Redis update frequency
```

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Features

### Smart User Management
- **Refresh Detection**: Distinguishes between disconnects and page refreshes
- **Grace Period Handling**: 30-second window for users to rejoin
- **Automatic Queue Maintenance**: Removes users who leave permanently

### Dynamic Enforcement
- **Automatic Mode Switching**: Seamlessly transitions between relaxed/strict modes
- **Real-time Announcements**: Keeps users informed of rule changes
- **Intelligent Notifications**: Context-aware messaging

### Admin Tools
- **Comprehensive Override**: Admins can bypass all restrictions
- **Bulk Operations**: Clear queues, reset timers, force sync
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time status reporting

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Commands not working:**
- Verify exact command format (case-sensitive)
- Check bot has speaking privileges in room
- Ensure queue system is enabled for user commands

**Admin commands failing:**
- Confirm username matches environment variables exactly
- Check bot has moderator privileges for user removal
- Verify environment variables are loaded correctly

**Queue state inconsistencies:**
- Use `/getcurrentdjbooth` to resync with room state
- Check Redis connection for live updates
- Restart bot if persistent issues occur

**Users not being managed properly:**
- Ensure bot has moderator privileges
- Check for network connectivity issues
- Verify room ID is correct in configuration

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG=true node deepcutBot.js
```

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics

The bot provides comprehensive logging for:
- Queue operations and state changes
- User lifecycle events (join/leave/refresh)
- Command execution and errors
- Redis publish/subscribe activity
- Admin actions and overrides

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Admin Authentication**: Username-based admin verification
- **Command Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in cooldowns prevent spam
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean termination on system signals
