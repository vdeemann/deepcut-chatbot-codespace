# DJ Queue Bot

A sophisticated Turntable.fm bot for managing DJ queues in music rooms with automatic queue management, fair play enforcement, and real-time updates.

## üéµ Overview

The DJ Queue Bot provides an automated queue management system for Turntable.fm rooms, designed to handle crowded rooms where many users want to DJ. It ensures everyone gets a fair chance to play music through intelligent queue management, dynamic rule enforcement, and comprehensive admin controls.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéØ Smart Queue Management
- **Automatic DJ Detection**: Automatically adds users to the queue when they join the decks
- **Dynamic Rule Enforcement**: Switches between relaxed and strict modes based on queue size
- **Fair Play System**: Prevents users from monopolizing the decks when others are waiting
- **Persistent Queue**: Users remain in queue even when stepping down from decks

### ‚ö° Real-Time Features
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Publishes queue status only when changes occur (no constant polling)
- **Song Tracking**: Broadcasts current song information for external integrations
- **Instant Notifications**: Real-time feedback for all queue operations
- **Auto-Sync**: Synchronizes with current DJ booth state
- **Bot Status Monitoring**: Discord integration includes bot health checks

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Controls
- **Admin Override System**: Comprehensive admin controls for queue management
- **Queue Locking**: Prevents unauthorized queue modifications
- **Wait Time Management**: 1-minute cooldown periods between DJ turns in strict mode
- **Graceful User Handling**: Manages user disconnections and refreshes intelligently

## üìã Queue Rules & Behavior

### Dynamic Queue Modes

**Relaxed Mode** (< 6 users in queue):
- DJs can play multiple songs per turn
- No automatic removal from decks
- Flexible queue management

**Strict Mode** (6+ users in queue):
- Each DJ limited to **one song per turn**
- **1-minute cooldown** before rejoining decks
- Automatic enforcement to ensure fairness
- Users remain in queue during cooldown
- Private message notifications when cooldown expires

### User Lifecycle Management

1. **Joining**: Users automatically added to queue when they get on decks
2. **Playing**: Song count tracked per DJ turn
3. **Cooldown**: 1-minute wait period in strict mode with private notifications
4. **Rejoining**: Can rejoin queue after cooldown expires
5. **Leaving**: 30-second grace period for page refreshes

### Welcome System

**Smart Welcome Messages**: All users receive personalized welcome messages regardless of queue status:

- **Queue Enabled**: Information about queue system and available commands
- **Queue Disabled**: Simple welcome with basic DJ instructions
- **Admin Users**: Additional information about admin commands
- **Returning Users**: Simplified welcome for users who refresh/rejoin

```

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install ttapi ioredis async-mutex discord.js
   ```

2. **Ensure required files:**
   - `queue.js` - Queue implementation class
   - `deepcutBot.js` - Main Turntable.fm bot file
   - `discordBot.js` - Discord integration bot (optional)
   - `.env` - Environment configuration

3. **Start the bots:**

   # Start the main Turntable.fm bot
   node deepcutBot.js
   
   # Start the Discord bot (in separate terminal)
   node discordBot.js
   ```

## üîå Redis Integration & Discord Bot

The bot provides real-time data through Redis channels for external integrations and includes a companion Discord bot for enhanced functionality.

### Redis Architecture

**Separate Connections**: Uses dedicated Redis connections for publishing and subscribing to prevent connection mode conflicts.

**Event-Driven Publishing**: Queue and song data is published only when actual changes occur, eliminating unnecessary network traffic.

### Redis Channels

#### Channel 1: Queue Status (`channel-1`)
Published when queue changes occur:

```json
{
  "DJs": "username1, username2, username3",
  "locked": false
}
```

**Special States:**
- `"DJs": "disabled"` - Queue system is disabled
- `"DJs": "Queue is empty"` - No users in queue

#### Channel 2: Song Information (`channel-2`)
Published on every new song and when requested:

```json
{
  "songName": "Song Title",
  "artist": "Artist Name", 
  "djName": "DJ Username",
  "startTime": 1683842567890,
  "roomName": "Room Name",
  "audience": ["listener1", "listener2"],
  "djsOnDecks": ["dj1", "dj2", "dj3"]
}
```

#### Channel 3: Bot Commands (`bot-commands`)
Used for communication between Discord and Turntable bots:

```json
{
  "command": "getCurrentRoomInfo",
  "timestamp": 1683842567890
}
```

### Discord Bot Integration

The companion Discord bot subscribes to Redis channels and provides enhanced community features with real-time room monitoring.

- **Status Updates**: Real-time feedback for all operations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Commands not working:**
- Verify exact command format (case-sensitive)
- Check bot has speaking privileges in room
- Ensure queue system is enabled for user commands

**Admin commands failing:**
- Confirm username matches environment variables exactly
- Check bot has moderator privileges for user removal
- Verify environment variables are loaded correctly

**Queue state inconsistencies:**
- Use `/getcurrentdjbooth` to resync with room state
- Check Redis connection for live updates
- Restart bot if persistent issues occur

**Discord bot showing "Unknown" data:**
- Verify Redis connections between both bots
- Check if turntable bot is online using `!playing`
- Ensure both bots use the same Redis instance

**Redis connection errors:**
- Verify Redis URL format and credentials
- Check network connectivity to Redis server
- Ensure both publisher and subscriber connections are working

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG=true node deepcutBot.js
```

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics

The bot provides comprehensive logging for:
- Queue operations and state changes
- User lifecycle events (join/leave/refresh)
- Command execution and errors
- Redis publish/subscribe activity
- Admin actions and overrides
- Discord bot integration status

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Admin Authentication**: Username-based admin verification
- **Command Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in cooldowns prevent spam
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean termination on system signals
- **Connection Security**: Separate Redis connections prevent interference
